# inmoov

This is a repository to hold my personal clone of the Inmoov robot, found at www.inmoov.fr.

This is NOT the official repository, this is a remix made by Gael Langevin under the CC BY-NC 3.0.

Changes are made mostly because I found it hard to build the robot without having too much adaptations to the 3D printer, also certain prints were simply impossible to replicate because the sizes did not match up. This version has all holes and features changed in such a way that it adheres to tolerances. It also will contain a BoM of all the items (including PLA) that are required to print a 3D robot yourself. All the items listed should be readily available from a hardware store or hobbyking.

Please be aware that your 3D printer must be FULLY calibrated before printing! This copy should be printable without any offsets, if your printer prints a cube of 20x20x20mm it should be able to print this too.
